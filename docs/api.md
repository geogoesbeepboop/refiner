# Refiner API Documentation

## Overview

The **Refiner** project is built using TypeScript and Node.js, designed to provide a robust framework for AI-driven brainstorming and refinement processes. The architecture emphasizes modularity, with distinct command files handling specific functionalities, and a service layer that abstracts AI client interactions. The design principles focus on maintainability, scalability, and ease of integration.

### Architecture

- **Modular Structure**: The codebase is organized into commands and services, allowing for clear separation of concerns.
- **Command Pattern**: Each command (e.g., `brainstorm`, `config`, `info`, `refine`) is encapsulated in its own module, promoting reusability and testability.
- **Service Layer**: The AI client services (`ai-client-factory` and `ai-client`) provide a consistent interface for interacting with AI functionalities.

## API Reference

### Endpoints

Currently, the Refiner project does not expose a RESTful API but provides command-line interface (CLI) commands. Below are the available commands:

| Command      | Description                              | Implementation File                     |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `brainstorm` | Initiates a brainstorming session        | `src/commands/brainstorm.ts`           |
| `config`     | Manages configuration settings           | `src/commands/config.ts`               |
| `info`       | Displays information about the project   | `src/commands/info.ts`                 |
| `refine`     | Refines ideas generated during brainstorming | `src/commands/refine.ts`               |

## Command Reference

### 1. Brainstorm Command

- **File**: `src/commands/brainstorm.ts`
- **Exports**: `Brainstorm` class
- **Functions**: 2

### 2. Config Command

- **File**: `src/commands/config.ts`
- **Exports**: `Config` class
- **Functions**: 3

### 3. Info Command

- **File**: `src/commands/info.ts`
- **Exports**: `Info` class
- **Functions**: 0

### 4. Refine Command

- **File**: `src/commands/refine.ts`
- **Exports**: `Refine` class
- **Functions**: 1

## Function Reference

### Key Functions

#### 1. Validate Function

- **Signature**: `validate: (input) =>`
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Async**: No
- **Files**:
  - `lib/commands/brainstorm.js`
  - `lib/commands/config.js`
  - `lib/commands/refine.js`
  - `lib/commands/refine/brainstorm.js`

#### 2. Get AI Client Function

- **Signature**: `function getAIClient()`
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Async**: No
- **Files**:
  - `lib/services/ai-client.d.ts`
  - `lib/services/ai-client.js`

## Usage Examples

### Brainstorm Command Example

To initiate a brainstorming session, you can use the following command:

```bash
node src/commands/brainstorm.ts
```

### Config Command Example

To manage configuration settings, run:

```bash
node src/commands/config.ts
```

## Request/Response Schemas

As the project currently does not expose a RESTful API, there are no request/response schemas to document.

## Error Handling

The project implements basic error handling patterns across commands. Common error patterns include:

- **Invalid Input**: When the input does not meet validation criteria, a descriptive error message is returned.
- **Configuration Errors**: Issues related to loading or parsing configuration files will trigger specific error messages.

## Configuration

### Configuration Files

The following configuration files are utilized within the project:

- `.claude/settings.local.json`
- `.mastro/analytics.json`
- `lib/utils/config.js`
- `src/utils/config.ts`

These files contain settings that can be adjusted to modify the behavior of the commands and services.

## Integration

To integrate with the Refiner functionality, you can import the relevant command classes into your application:

```typescript
import { Brainstorm } from './src/commands/brainstorm';
import { Config } from './src/commands/config';
```

You can then instantiate these classes and call their methods as needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid Command Usage**: Ensure that the command is called with the correct syntax.
2. **Configuration Not Found**: Verify that the configuration files exist and are correctly formatted.
3. **AI Client Errors**: If the AI client fails to initialize, check the underlying service dependencies.

For further assistance, refer to the error messages provided during command execution, which will guide you to the specific issue encountered.
