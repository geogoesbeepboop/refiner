# Refiner API Documentation

## Overview of the API Architecture and Design Principles

The Refiner API is designed to facilitate seamless integration with the Mastro CLI system, providing developers with a robust set of tools for workflow orchestration, code review, commit management, and documentation generation. The architecture is built on TypeScript and Node.js, ensuring type safety and scalability. Key design principles include:

- **Modularity**: Each component (e.g., `mastro flow`, `mastro review`) is encapsulated, promoting separation of concerns.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: While many functions are synchronous for simplicity, the architecture supports asynchronous operations where necessary.
- **Extensibility**: The API is designed to allow for future enhancements without breaking existing functionality.

## Authentication and Authorization

Currently, the Refiner API does not require authentication or authorization for accessing its endpoints. Future versions may introduce token-based authentication to secure sensitive operations.

## Detailed Endpoint Documentation

### 1. Validate Input

#### Endpoint: `/api/validate`

- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: Validates the input provided for various commands.

#### Request

```json
{
  "input": "Your input string here"
}
```

#### Response

- **Success (200)**

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "message": "Input is valid."
}
```

- **Error (400)**

```json
{
  "valid": false,
  "message": "Input is invalid."
}
```

### Example Usage

#### JavaScript

```javascript
fetch('/api/validate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ input: "Your input string here" })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

#### Python

```python
import requests

response = requests.post('/api/validate', json={"input": "Your input string here"})
print(response.json())
```

## Request/Response Schemas

### Request Schema

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "input": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The input string to validate."
    }
  },
  "required": ["input"]
}
```

### Response Schema

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "valid": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "description": "Indicates if the input is valid."
    },
    "message": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Validation message."
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling and Status Codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid (e.g., missing parameters).
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

## Rate Limiting and Usage Guidelines

Currently, there are no rate limits imposed on the API. However, users are encouraged to implement their own throttling mechanisms to avoid overwhelming the service, especially during high-volume operations.

## SDK/Client Library Information

The Refiner API can be accessed directly via HTTP requests. For convenience, a client library is available in the `lib/services` directory, which includes functions like `getAIClient()` and `getClaudeClient()` for easy integration.

### Example of Using the Client Library

#### TypeScript

```typescript
import { getAIClient } from './lib/services/ai-client';

const client = getAIClient();
client.validate("Your input string here").then(response => {
  console.log(response);
});
```

## Code Examples in Multiple Languages

### Node.js Example

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

axios.post('/api/validate', { input: "Your input string here" })
  .then(response => console.log(response.data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### Ruby Example

```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'json'

uri = URI('/api/validate')
response = Net::HTTP.post(uri, { input: "Your input string here" }.to_json, "Content-Type" => "application/json")
puts response.body
```

## Testing and Development Guidelines

1. **Local Development**: Clone the repository and install dependencies using `npm install`.
2. **Running Tests**: Use `npm test` to run the test suite.
3. **Debugging**: Utilize Node.js debugging tools to step through the code and identify issues.
4. **Documentation Generation**: Use the built-in documentation generation capabilities to create multi-format documentation, including Mermaid diagrams.

## Conclusion

The Refiner API provides a powerful and flexible interface for integrating with the Mastro CLI system. By following the guidelines and examples provided in this documentation, developers can effectively utilize the API to enhance their workflows and improve code quality.
