# Refiner API Documentation

## Overview of the API Architecture and Design Principles

The Refiner API is designed to facilitate seamless integration with the Mastro CLI system, providing a robust set of functionalities for workflow orchestration, AI-powered code review, intelligent commit analysis, and documentation generation. The architecture follows RESTful principles, ensuring that the API is stateless, scalable, and easy to consume.

### Key Design Principles:
- **Modularity**: Each component (e.g., `mastro flow`, `mastro review`) is encapsulated, allowing for independent development and deployment.
- **Consistency**: Uniform naming conventions and response formats across endpoints.
- **Extensibility**: The API is designed to accommodate future enhancements without breaking existing functionality.

## Authentication and Authorization

Currently, the Refiner API does not require authentication for accessing its endpoints. However, future versions may introduce token-based authentication to secure sensitive operations.

## Detailed Endpoint Documentation

### 1. Validate Input

#### Endpoint
```
POST /api/validate
```

#### Description
Validates input data for various commands in the Mastro CLI.

#### Request Schema
```json
{
  "input": {
    "type": "string",
    "description": "The input data to validate."
  }
}
```

#### Response Schema
```json
{
  "valid": {
    "type": "boolean",
    "description": "Indicates if the input is valid."
  },
  "message": {
    "type": "string",
    "description": "Validation message."
  }
}
```

#### Example Request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/validate \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"input": "some input data"}'
```

#### Example Response
```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "message": "Input is valid."
}
```

### 2. Get AI Client

#### Endpoint
```
GET /api/ai-client
```

#### Description
Retrieves the AI client instance for code review and validation.

#### Response Schema
```json
{
  "client": {
    "type": "object",
    "description": "The AI client instance."
  }
}
```

#### Example Request
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/ai-client
```

#### Example Response
```json
{
  "client": {
    "name": "AI Client",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling and Status Codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid (e.g., missing parameters).
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource does not exist.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

### Example Error Response
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid input data."
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting and Usage Guidelines

Currently, there are no rate limits enforced on the API. However, it is recommended to implement best practices for API consumption, such as:

- Caching responses where applicable.
- Minimizing the frequency of requests to avoid unnecessary load on the server.

## SDK/Client Library Information

The Refiner API can be accessed using any HTTP client. For TypeScript developers, a simple SDK can be created to wrap the API calls. Below is an example of a basic SDK function:

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';

export const validateInput = async (input: string) => {
  const response = await axios.post('/api/validate', { input });
  return response.data;
};
```

## Code Examples in Multiple Languages

### JavaScript Example
```javascript
fetch('/api/validate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ input: 'some input data' }),
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Python Example
```python
import requests

response = requests.post('http://localhost:3000/api/validate', json={'input': 'some input data'})
print(response.json())
```

## Testing and Development Guidelines

To ensure the quality and reliability of the Refiner API, follow these guidelines:

1. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for each function to validate expected behavior.
2. **Integration Testing**: Test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or automated testing frameworks.
3. **Documentation Updates**: Keep the API documentation up to date with any changes in functionality or endpoints.

### Example Unit Test (Using Jest)
```typescript
import { validateInput } from './api';

test('validates input correctly', async () => {
  const result = await validateInput('valid input');
  expect(result.valid).toBe(true);
});
```

By following this documentation, developers can effectively integrate with the Refiner API, leveraging its capabilities to enhance their workflow and code quality.
