# Refiner API Documentation

## Overview of the API Architecture and Design Principles

The Refiner API is designed to facilitate seamless integration with the Mastro CLI system, providing developers with a robust set of tools for workflow orchestration, AI-powered code review, intelligent commit analysis, and documentation generation. The API follows RESTful principles, ensuring that it is stateless, cacheable, and provides a uniform interface for interaction.

### Key Design Principles:
- **Modularity**: Each component (e.g., `mastro flow`, `mastro review`) is encapsulated, allowing for independent development and deployment.
- **Consistency**: Uniform naming conventions and response structures across endpoints.
- **Extensibility**: The API is designed to accommodate future enhancements without breaking existing functionality.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses to aid in debugging and integration.

## Authentication and Authorization

Currently, the Refiner API does not require authentication for access. However, future versions may implement token-based authentication to secure sensitive operations. Keep an eye on updates for any changes in this regard.

## Detailed Endpoint Documentation

### 1. Validate Input

#### Endpoint: `/api/validate`

- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: Validates the input provided by the user.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "input": "string"
  }
  ```

- **Response**:
  - **200 OK**: Validation successful.
    ```json
    {
      "valid": true,
      "message": "Input is valid."
    }
    ```
  - **400 Bad Request**: Validation failed.
    ```json
    {
      "valid": false,
      "message": "Input is invalid."
    }
    ```

#### Example Request (cURL):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/validate \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"input": "your input here"}'
```

### 2. Get AI Client

#### Endpoint: `/api/ai-client`

- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Retrieves the AI client instance for processing.
- **Response**:
  - **200 OK**: Successfully retrieved AI client.
    ```json
    {
      "client": "AI Client Instance"
    }
    ```

#### Example Request (cURL):
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/ai-client
```

## Request/Response Schemas

### Request Schema for Validation
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "input": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": ["input"]
}
```

### Response Schema for Validation
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "valid": {
      "type": "boolean"
    },
    "message": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling and Status Codes

The API employs standard HTTP status codes for error handling:

- **400 Bad Request**: The server cannot process the request due to client error.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

### Error Response Example
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid input provided."
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting and Usage Guidelines

Currently, there are no rate limits imposed on the API. However, for optimal performance, it is recommended to avoid sending excessive requests in a short period. Future versions may introduce rate limiting based on user feedback and usage patterns.

## SDK/Client Library Information

While there is no official SDK available at this time, developers can interact with the API using standard HTTP clients in their preferred programming languages. Below are examples in JavaScript and Python.

### JavaScript Example
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function validateInput(input) {
  const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/api/validate', { input });
  console.log(response.data);
}

validateInput("your input here");
```

### Python Example
```python
import requests

def validate_input(input):
    response = requests.post('http://localhost:3000/api/validate', json={'input': input})
    print(response.json())

validate_input("your input here")
```

## Testing and Development Guidelines

### Local Development Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/refiner.git
   cd refiner
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Running Tests
To run the test suite, execute:
```bash
npm test
```

### Contribution Guidelines
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
- Ensure code is well-documented and follows the project's coding standards.
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
