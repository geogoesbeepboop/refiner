# Refiner API Documentation

## Overview of the API Architecture and Design Principles

The Refiner API is designed to facilitate seamless integration with the Mastro CLI system, enabling developers to orchestrate workflows, perform AI-powered code reviews, and manage commits and pull requests. The architecture follows a modular design, allowing for easy extension and maintenance. Key design principles include:

- **Modularity**: Each component (e.g., `mastro flow`, `mastro review`) is encapsulated, promoting separation of concerns.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: While many functions are synchronous, the architecture supports asynchronous operations for scalability.
- **Extensibility**: The API is designed to be easily extendable, allowing for future enhancements without breaking existing functionality.

## Authentication and Authorization

Currently, the Refiner API does not require authentication or authorization for its endpoints. Future versions may introduce token-based authentication to enhance security.

## Detailed Endpoint Documentation

### 1. Validate Input

#### Endpoint: `/validate`

- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: Validates input data across various commands.
  
#### Request

```json
{
  "input": "string"
}
```

#### Response

- **Success (200)**

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "message": "Input is valid."
}
```

- **Error (400)**

```json
{
  "valid": false,
  "message": "Input is invalid."
}
```

#### Example

**Request**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/validate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"input": "example"}'
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "message": "Input is valid."
}
```

### 2. Get AI Client

#### Endpoint: `/ai-client`

- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Retrieves the AI client instance for performing AI-related tasks.

#### Response

- **Success (200)**

```json
{
  "client": "AI Client Instance"
}
```

#### Example

**Request**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/ai-client
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "client": "AI Client Instance"
}
```

## Request/Response Schemas

### Request Schema

```json
{
  "input": "string"
}
```

### Response Schema

```json
{
  "valid": "boolean",
  "message": "string"
}
```

## Error Handling and Status Codes

| Status Code | Description                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| 200         | Request succeeded                    |
| 400         | Bad request; validation failed       |
| 500         | Internal server error                |

## Rate Limiting and Usage Guidelines

Currently, there are no rate limits imposed on the API. However, it is recommended to implement client-side throttling to prevent overwhelming the server during high-load scenarios.

## SDK/Client Library Information

The Refiner API can be accessed directly via HTTP requests. For convenience, a TypeScript SDK is available for integration into Node.js applications. 

### Installation

```bash
npm install refiner-sdk
```

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { RefinerClient } from 'refiner-sdk';

const client = new RefinerClient();

async function validateInput(input: string) {
    const response = await client.validate({ input });
    console.log(response);
}

validateInput("example");
```

## Code Examples in Multiple Languages

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3000/validate', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ input: 'example' })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Python Example

```python
import requests

response = requests.post('http://localhost:3000/validate', json={'input': 'example'})
print(response.json())
```

## Testing and Development Guidelines

1. **Local Development**: Clone the repository and run the server using `npm start`.
2. **Testing**: Use Postman or curl to test the endpoints.
3. **Unit Tests**: Ensure all new features are covered by unit tests. Use Jest for testing.

### Example Test Case

```typescript
test('validates input correctly', async () => {
    const response = await client.validate({ input: 'example' });
    expect(response.valid).toBe(true);
});
```

## Conclusion

The Refiner API provides a robust framework for integrating with the Mastro CLI system. By following this documentation, developers can effectively utilize the API to enhance their workflows and improve code quality through AI-powered tools.
