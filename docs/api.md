# Refiner API Documentation

## Overview of the API Architecture and Design Principles

The Refiner API is designed to facilitate seamless integration with the Mastro CLI system, providing developers with tools for workflow orchestration, AI-powered code review, intelligent commit analysis, and documentation generation. The API follows RESTful principles, ensuring that it is stateless, cacheable, and provides a uniform interface.

### Key Design Principles:
- **Modularity**: Each component (e.g., `mastro flow`, `mastro review`) is encapsulated, allowing for independent development and deployment.
- **Simplicity**: The API is designed to be intuitive, with clear endpoints and straightforward request/response structures.
- **Extensibility**: New features can be added without disrupting existing functionality, supporting future growth.

## Authentication and Authorization

Currently, the Refiner API does not require authentication for accessing its endpoints. However, future enhancements may include token-based authentication to secure sensitive operations.

## Detailed Endpoint Documentation

### 1. Validate Input

#### Endpoint
```
POST /api/validate
```

#### Description
Validates the input provided to the Mastro CLI commands.

#### Request Schema
```json
{
  "input": "string"
}
```

#### Response Schema
```json
{
  "isValid": "boolean",
  "message": "string"
}
```

#### Example Request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/validate \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"input": "your input here"}'
```

#### Example Response
```json
{
  "isValid": true,
  "message": "Input is valid."
}
```

### 2. Get AI Client

#### Endpoint
```
GET /api/ai-client
```

#### Description
Retrieves the AI client instance for code review and validation.

#### Response Schema
```json
{
  "client": "object"
}
```

#### Example Request
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/ai-client
```

#### Example Response
```json
{
  "client": {
    "name": "AI Client",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 3. Get Claude Client

#### Endpoint
```
GET /api/claude-client
```

#### Description
Retrieves the Claude client instance for advanced AI functionalities.

#### Response Schema
```json
{
  "client": "object"
}
```

#### Example Request
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/claude-client
```

#### Example Response
```json
{
  "client": {
    "name": "Claude Client",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling and Status Codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was malformed or invalid.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource does not exist.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

### Example Error Response
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid input provided."
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting and Usage Guidelines

Currently, there are no rate limits imposed on the API. However, it is recommended to implement best practices for API usage, including:

- Avoiding excessive requests in a short period.
- Caching responses where applicable to reduce load.

## SDK/Client Library Information

The Refiner API can be accessed using any HTTP client. For convenience, a TypeScript SDK is available, which simplifies interactions with the API.

### Example SDK Usage
```typescript
import { RefinerAPI } from 'refiner-sdk';

const api = new RefinerAPI();

async function validateInput(input: string) {
  const response = await api.validate({ input });
  console.log(response);
}

validateInput("your input here");
```

## Code Examples in Multiple Languages

### JavaScript Example
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/validate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ input: 'your input here' })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Python Example
```python
import requests

response = requests.post('http://localhost:3000/api/validate', json={'input': 'your input here'})
print(response.json())
```

## Testing and Development Guidelines

To ensure the stability and reliability of the Refiner API, follow these guidelines during development:

1. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for each function to validate expected behavior.
2. **Integration Testing**: Test the API endpoints with various input scenarios to ensure robustness.
3. **Documentation**: Keep the API documentation updated with any changes to endpoints or functionality.
4. **Version Control**: Use semantic versioning for API changes to communicate breaking changes effectively.

By adhering to these practices, developers can maintain a high-quality API that meets the needs of its users.
